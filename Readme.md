# AIrtisan

Hallucination-free LLM-based chatbots, with a focus on an easy developer experience. This is the source code, use it wisely and with regards to the license. I had a lot of fun building this, although it's not really something that I work on too often now. I'd like to continue to add features as they become useful, and if anyone is interested in contributing, feel free to [reach out](mailto:aidantilgner02@gmail.com).
